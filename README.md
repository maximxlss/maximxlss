You have stumbled onto my personal README. Here you can learn more about who I am and what I do, if you're interested.

Besides, you can contact me using any of the ways listed above, feel free to do so! I'm open to invitations and other opportunities.

## Areas of interest
1. **🛡️Infosec / CTF :** I'm a member of [<picture><img alt="WWF" src="logo_wwf.png" height="60" align="center"></picture> World Wide Flags](https://ctftime.org/team/283853) (top 50 worldwide), also [LCD](https://ctftime.org/team/270230/), historically also [xls team](https://ctftime.org/team/271856) and sometimes in other teams, specializing in cryptography/math/PPC/Rust. See my writeups over on [writeups.xls.msk.ru](https://writeups.xls.msk.ru/)\
Interested in developing CTF tasks of my specialization or doing vulnerability research. Feel free to reach out!
2. **🔒Systems programming :** Interested in all kinds of systems programming, I'm (slowly) working on implementing a firmware for a electronic badge, a language interpreter and a hobby operating system. I would love to get into developing operating systems, interpreters/compilers, formal verification software or even hardware!
3. **📖Infosec education :** Sometimes I teach CTF cryptography! You might find some recordings of my lectures (they probably are in Russian currently) over on my [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Maximxls). If you need that kind of service, let me know!
4. **🕹️Games :** I play different genres, but love indie puzzles the most. Some of my favourite games are: To the moon series, Outer Wilds, SIGNALIS. Also [Tetr.io](https://ch.tetr.io/u/maximxls) S- rank, [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10891536) 2493pp.
5. **🔍Algorithmic programming :** previously active at [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/maximxls) and in Russian olympiads. Achieved a 2nd award in the Moscow olympiad for school students.
6. **🧑‍💻Coding :** I would consider invites for project and hackathons, you can see samples of my code here on Github (not the best of my code, honestly, but better than nothing)

## Some of my skills
- Programming: 🥇Python, 🥈Rust, 🥉Go, Kotlin
- Language: native Russian, B2 - Upper Intermediate English, starting to learn Japanese!
- Cryptography: Familiar with all the common cryptosystems, lattice based cryptanalysis, differential cryptanalysis.
- CTF besides cryptography: basic pwn techniques, networking, fuzzing, debugging, static binary analysis.
- Algorithms: dynamic programming, binary trees, sorting, asymptotic analysis, all the basic stuff.
- Linux, Docker, basic deploy stuff.
