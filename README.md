### Hi there 👋

My name is Max. I'm a man from Russia. I play games, watch anime, write code.
- 👨‍💻 I code in: Rust, Python
- 📫 How to reach me: The preferred way is Telegram: @maximxlss, but Discord is also okay: maximxls#9992.
- 🎮 What games do I play: Primarily competitive Tetris. I do sometimes play different games of various genres.
- 🖥️ What is my setup: I have an Intel Xeon e5-1650 v1, 16 Gb RAM and Nvidia GTX 1070. I also have a 144 hz display, a mechanical keyboard, Oculus Quest 2, Nintendo Switch and Novation Launchkey 25.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I use my nickname for over a half of my life. It's a combination of a way to write my full first name: maxim and a meaningless three letters xls. It's read as maxim and then x, l and s separately. At the end of my nickname sometimes is an extra s because some time in the past I created an account with nickname maximxls. My google account was then stolen, and I lost access to that account.

Please feel free to tell me about the possible typos or any mistakes in this readme using github issues. I'm not a native speaker, so I would appreciate if you might help me learn more.
